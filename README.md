# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The objective of this data analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of ride-share data from PyBer. We were given multiple .csv files that had incredible amounts of data in each file. With the given data, I was supposed to merge the files into one cohesive DataFrama. Using the information, we were tasked to answer a number of questions that would help answer many questions based on the different city types.

## Results
After manipulating the data, I was able to determine many answers. The first step was to divide the data among the 3 different city types:
* Rural
* Suburban
* Urban

Per city type, I found:
* Total number of rides
* Total drivers
* Total amount of fares
* The average fare per ride
* The average fare per driver
